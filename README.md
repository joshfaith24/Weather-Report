# Weather-Report
Building the weather application using API's is designed
to update dynamically and be able to show weather report for 5 days
in whatever city the user types in, as long as it is an acceptable
city. API's allow developers to access their data, which is what 
this application does in order to display weather for users to see
based on their travel, hometown, etc...

## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Review
Accessing the API's for the weather display was challenging at first,
trying to decide how to implant it into my code in order to retrieve
the data from this API. The Weather Report should display 5 days of temperature, humidity, precipation and other variables of the weather for
the user, based on the city they choose. The user will then be able to plan accordingly, whether they are looking to plan a trip or just know the weather in the city/state they reside in.
